## Introduction
This report examines Frederick Brooks' seminal paper "No Silver Bullet" and its enduring relevance to modern software engineering. We analyze the fundamental challenges in software design and demonstrate how strategic application of design patterns can help mitigate these inherent difficulties.

**Key Questions Addressed:**
- Why does Brooks argue there's "no silver bullet" for software engineering?
- How have these challenges evolved in contemporary development?
- What approaches can help overcome these obstacles?

## Key Challenges
### Essential Difficulties
1. **Complexity**: Inherent complexity of software systems
2. **Conformity**: Requirements to interface with existing systems
3. **Changeability**: Frequent requirement changes
4. **Invisibility**: Lack of physical representation

### Accidental Difficulties
- Tool limitations
- Implementation challenges
- Legacy system integration

## Design Patterns
We examine three critical design patterns and their applications:

| Pattern | Problem Addressed | Our Implementation |
|---------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Strategy | Algorithm variability | Dynamic physics system |
| Observer | State synchronization | VR controller input |
| Facade | Complex subsystem interface | VR hardware abstraction |

## Case Study: VR Curling Simulation
### Problem Context
Developing a physics-accurate VR curling game that must:
- Handle real-time physics calculations
- Support multiple input modalities
- Maintain 90+ FPS in VR

### Applied Solutions
1. **Strategy Pattern** for different sweeping techniques
2. **Observer Pattern** for controller input handling
3. **Facade Pattern** for Oculus SDK integration

## Task Allocation
| Team Member | Responsibilities |
|-------------|------------------|
| Linfeng Li | Physics system strategy implementation |
| Griven Nathanael | Observer pattern for input handling |
| Yuefei Wang | Facade pattern for VR hardware |
| Darlyn Meinardy | Case study documentation |
| Huayuan Zheng | Performance optimization |

## Lessons Learned
1. **Pattern Limitations**: Not all challenges can be pattern-solved
2. **VR-Specific Considerations**: Latency requirements impact pattern choices
3. **Team Coordination**: Distributed pattern implementation challenges

**Conclusion**: While design patterns provide powerful tools, they confirm Brooks' assertion that no single solution can address all software engineering challenges.
