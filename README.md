# 🧠 Strategy Design Pattern — Assignment 1

This repository explores the **Strategy Design Pattern** through a series of essays, implementations, and real-world applications across various domains including game development and mobile applications.

---

## 📚 Introduction

The **Strategy Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.
